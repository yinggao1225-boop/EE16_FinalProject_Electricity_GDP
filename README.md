# EE16 Final Project – Predicting U.S. GDP from Electricity Retail Sales

## Project Description
This project explores whether U.S. electricity retail sales can be used as an indicator to predict U.S. GDP.  
Using historical quarterly data, we perform data preprocessing, visualization, and regression analysis to study the relationship between electricity consumption and economic activity.

## Data
- U.S. quarterly electricity retail sales (source: [])
- U.S. quarterly GDP (source: [])

Both datasets are loaded and merged by date using pandas.

## Methods
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, type conversion)
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization (time series plots, scatter plots)
- Linear regression models to predict GDP from electricity sales
- Evaluation using R² and residual analysis

## How to Run
1. Install Python 3 and the following libraries:
   - `numpy`
   - `pandas`
   - `matplotlib`
   - `scikit-learn`
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (or Google Colab) file for this project.
3. Run all cells in order.
